#### NOTE

The *PowerShell Best Practices* are always evolving, and continue to be edited and updated as the language and tools (and our community understanding of them) evolve. We encourage you to check back for new editions at least twice a year, by visiting https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle

The *PowerShell Style Guide* in particular is in PREVIEW, and we are still actively working out our disagreements about the rules in the guide through the github issues system. Please don't be suprised if over then next few weeks we change rules to contradict what they say at this current moment.
